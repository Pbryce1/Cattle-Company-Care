         <h2>Convenient Cattle Care Company</h2>
         <p>Welcome! Convenient Cattle Care Company was established in May of 2012. This company was created for local ranchers and farmers who need an extra hand, or hands to keep their herd healthy. Raising, breeding and growing cattle can be a rigorous career for one or few men or women. Our company provides a service that cares for large heads of cattle when a farmer need assistance in delivering necessary health procedures to his or her herd. We can round up 50 + cattle herds, deliver medicines, vaccines, pregnancy tests and many other health necessities in a timely manner! </p>
         <p>Here at Cattle Care we know what these men and women are doing to keep their land and livestock healthy and growing. Waking up at the crack of dawn does not get easier as the time passes on and as the breeding season begins, the times get tougher. We have a trusted team of medically trained veterinarian and farm experienced folks who will do the dirty work that is required to keep herds healthy.  From pregnant heifers to their weaning babies, we can do the job for you. We can free up your valuable time to be able to get other important tasks done on the farm.</p>
